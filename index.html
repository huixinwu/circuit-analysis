          This OER material is intended for use as the first level of Circuit Analysis, with emphasis in Direct Current - dc, for a two and four year engineering technology program. The lecture and laboratory manual contains twelve weekly lecture and laboratory experiments. The topics range from basic technical math through principles of circuit analysis such as series, parallel, and series-parallel dc circuit; network theorems (Thevenin’s theorem and maximum power transfer) and circuit methods of analysis (mesh and nodal analysis, source transformation, and source conversion) of solving dc circuits; dc power analysis; capacitance and inductance principles and transient circuit; and introduction to sinusoidal. The course includes a three hours of laboratory work.
          <br><br>
          Lab experiments include brief introduction of the experimental topics, step by step procedures, tables and graphs to record measurements, and questions to reinforce the understanding of the theory with the experimental results. Each lab experiment is designed to be completed using a two to three hour practicum period. For equipment, each lab station should include a dual adjustable DC power supply and a quality DMM capable of reading DC voltage, current and resistance.

            As we already learned in Chapter 2 about circuit terminology and basic circuit concepts such as current, voltage, and power in an electric circuit.

    <!-- LAB EXPERIMENTS -->
    <section class="labExp" id="labExp">
      <h2 class="subtitleProject">Lab Experiments</h2>
      <p class="labIntro">
        Lab experiments from this section is from a collaborative project between the department of Engineering Technology in Queensborough Community College, QCC, and the department of Computer Engineering Technology in New York City College of Technology, NYCCT, is based on creating two laboratory manual for the course of dc circuit analysis and ac circuit analysis. In QCC, the circuit analysis courses are major required courses for students on most of the engineering technology majors. In NYCCT, the circuit analysis courses are major required courses for students in the Electromechanical Engineering Technology and Computer Engineering Technology programs. Creation of these two laboratory manuals that covers the appropriate materials to a sufficient depth of learning circuits analysis while remains readable and accessible manner for the students.
        <br><br>
        This lab manual section is intended for use in DC circuit analysis laboratory for a two and four year engineering technology program. The laboratory manual contains 15 weekly lab experiments that include brief introduction of the experimental topics, step by step procedures, tables and graphs to record measurements, and questions to reinforce the understanding of the theory with the experimental results.
        Each lab experiment is designed to be completed using a two to three hour practicum period. The topics range from basic laboratory procedures and resistor identification through series-parallel circuits, mesh analysis, superposition theorem, Thévenin’s theorem, maximum power transfer theorem, and concludes with an introduction to capacitors and inductors. For equipment, each lab station should include a dual adjustable DC power supply and a quality DMM capable of reading DC voltage, current and resistance.
