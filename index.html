          This OER material is intended for use as the first level of Circuit Analysis, with emphasis in Direct Current - dc, for a two and four year engineering technology program. The lecture and laboratory manual contains twelve weekly lecture and laboratory experiments. The topics range from basic technical math through principles of circuit analysis such as series, parallel, and series-parallel dc circuit; network theorems (Thevenin’s theorem and maximum power transfer) and circuit methods of analysis (mesh and nodal analysis, source transformation, and source conversion) of solving dc circuits; dc power analysis; capacitance and inductance principles and transient circuit; and introduction to sinusoidal. The course includes a three hours of laboratory work.
          <br><br>
          Lab experiments include brief introduction of the experimental topics, step by step procedures, tables and graphs to record measurements, and questions to reinforce the understanding of the theory with the experimental results. Each lab experiment is designed to be completed using a two to three hour practicum period. For equipment, each lab station should include a dual adjustable DC power supply and a quality DMM capable of reading DC voltage, current and resistance.

		   <button class="collapsible">7. Circuit Theorem: Source Transformation</button>
          <div class="content">
            Chapter 7 presents a tools to solve complex circuit where the traditional method of series-parallel analysis is not enough to find the voltage and current within the circuit. A source transformation is the process of replacing a voltage source in series with a resistor R by a current source in parallel with the same resistor R, or vice versa. The purpose of this substitution is to allow the elements within the circuit to be rearranged, without changing the voltage and current equivalency, in a way that the circuit can be analyzed as series or parallel.
            <br><br>
            <p>

              <li>convert a voltage source in series with an equivalent resistor to a current source in parallel with the same resistor.</li>
              <li>identify the most feasible way to apply a series or parallel source conversion in a complex resistivity circuit with different sources. </li>

        <button class="collapsible">8. Circuit Theorem: Superposition</button>
          <div class="content">
            Circuits with two or more sources usually can not be solved using the traditional method of solving series-parallel circuit. Therefore, Superposition is another circuit theorem uses to solve circuits with two or more sources. Superposition theorem determines the contribution of each independent source to the variable and then algebraically add them up.
            <br><br>
            The superposition principle states that the voltage across (or current through) an element in a linear circuit is the algebraic sum of the voltages across (or currents through) that element due to each independent source acting alone.
            <p>
              By the end of chapter 8,  students should be able to:
              <ul>

            Chapter 9 presents a circuit method of analysis to solve for a complex circuit. Mesh analysis provides another general procedure for analyzing circuits, using mesh currents as the circuit variables. Using mesh currents instead of element currents as circuit variables is convenient and reduces the number of equations that must be solved simultaneously.

        <button class="collapsible">10. Circuit Theorem: Thevenin's theorem </button>
          <div class="content">
            It often occurs in practice that a particular element in a circuit is variable (usually called the load) while other elements are fixed. As a typical example, a household outlet terminal may be connected to different appliances constituting a variable load. Each time the variable element is changed, the entire circuit has to be analyzed all over again. To avoid this problem, Thevenin’s theorem provides a technique by which the fixed part of the circuit is replaced by an equivalent circuit. (Fundamental of Electrical Circuit, page 139).
            <br><br>
            Chapter 10 introduces a new circuit thereom uses to analyze the equivalent voltage and resistance as seen in a load element in a circuit. This theorem is known as the Thevenin's theorem. Thevenin's theorem applies to a circuit where one element or branch of the circuit, the load, changes while the rest of the circuit is fixed. Therefore, instead of analyzing the entire circuit for each changes in the load branch, we can just simplify the fixed part of the circuit into one equivalent voltage source, Thevenin's voltage, VTH, in series with one equivalent resistance, Thevenin's resistance, RTH, as seen by the load element, RL. This simplified circuit results in one series circuit with three elements, VTH, RTH, and RL. Hence, it is easier to analyze the original from its equivalent Thevenin's circuit for each changes in RL.
            <p>
              By the end of chapter 10,  students should be able to:
              <ul>
                <li>find the equivalent Thevenin’s resistance in a circuit as seen by the load component. </li>
                <li>Find the equivalent Thevenin’s voltage source in a circuit as seen by the load component.</li>
              </ul>

            <div class="content">
              So far we have limited our study to resistive circuits. Chapter 12 introduces one new and important passive linear circuit element, which is the inductor. Unlike resistors, which dissipate energy, capacitors and inductors do not dissipate but store energy, which can be retrieved at a later time. For this reason, capacitors and inductors are called storage element. Capacitors will be introduced at Chapter 13.
              <br><br>
              Chapter 12 covers the fundamentals of magnetism and inductance, and how to solve the equivalent inductance of inductors connected in series, parallel, and series-parallel.
              <p>Be the end of chapter 12, students should be able to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>understand magnetism and the definition of magnetic field.</li>
                <li>find the equivalent inductance in series, parallel, and series-parallel connection. </li>

          <button class="collapsible">13. Capacitance and RC Transient Circuit</button>
            <div class="content">
              A capacitor is a passive element designed to store energy in its electric field. Besides resistors, capacitors are the most common electrical components. Chapter 13 covers the principle of electrical field, capacitance, and how to solve the equivalent capacitance connected in series, parallel, and series-parallel.
              <br><br>
              The second topic of chapter 13 is <i>Transient Response in a RC circuit</i>. In electric circuit, transient is a behavior of a circuit that occurs during a transition from one circuit condition to another that differs from the initial condition, such as the change in the amplitude, phase, shape, or frequency of the voltage acting in the circuit, the values of the parameters, or the configuration of the circuit. The Transient Response in a RC circuit is the way the circuit responds to energies stored in the capacitor, C, known as charging phase. If a capacitor has energy stored within it, then that energy can be dissipated/absorbed by a resistor, R, at the discharge phase.
              <p>By the end of chapter 13, students should be able to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>understand capacitance and the definition of electric field. </li>
                <li>find the equivalent capacitance in series, parallel, and series-parallel connection.</li>
                <li>analyze the time constant and instantaneous voltage across the resistor, VR, and capacitor, VC, and current through the capacitor, IC, in the charging phase of a RC circuit.</li>
                <li>graph the voltage across the resistor and capacitor, and the current through the capacitor in a RC circuit: charging and dischargin phase</li>
              </ul>

    <!-- LAB EXPERIMENTS -->
    <section class="labExp" id="labExp">
      <h2 class="subtitleProject">Lab Experiments</h2>
      <p class="labIntro">
        Lab experiments from this section is from a collaborative project between the department of Engineering Technology in Queensborough Community College, QCC, and the department of Computer Engineering Technology in New York City College of Technology, NYCCT, is based on creating two laboratory manual for the course of dc circuit analysis and ac circuit analysis. In QCC, the circuit analysis courses are major required courses for students on most of the engineering technology majors. In NYCCT, the circuit analysis courses are major required courses for students in the Electromechanical Engineering Technology and Computer Engineering Technology programs. Creation of these two laboratory manuals that covers the appropriate materials to a sufficient depth of learning circuits analysis while remains readable and accessible manner for the students.
        <br><br>
        This lab manual section is intended for use in DC circuit analysis laboratory for a two and four year engineering technology program. The laboratory manual contains 15 weekly lab experiments that include brief introduction of the experimental topics, step by step procedures, tables and graphs to record measurements, and questions to reinforce the understanding of the theory with the experimental results.
        Each lab experiment is designed to be completed using a two to three hour practicum period. The topics range from basic laboratory procedures and resistor identification through series-parallel circuits, mesh analysis, superposition theorem, Thévenin’s theorem, maximum power transfer theorem, and concludes with an introduction to capacitors and inductors. For equipment, each lab station should include a dual adjustable DC power supply and a quality DMM capable of reading DC voltage, current and resistance.

   <button class="collapsible colorLab">Lab Safety and Lab Behavior </button>
      <div class="content">
        <i style="font-size:0.8em;">Information retrieved from <a href="https://www.elitechgroup.com/news/product-news/the-importance-of-safety-in-the-lab">ELITechGroup: The importance of safety in the lab</a></i>
        <br><br>
        <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>
          Laboratories reap a wide array of safety hazards, which is why it is so vital to understand the important of lab safety. If something goes awry, more than just your research project schedule can be affected. Equipment can be damaged, fines can occur, and individuals on your team can be injured.
          <br><br>
          When working in a lab, it is important you to be familiar with the equipment in your working space, even if you don’t use it yourself. It’s also crucial to be cautious of what other researchers, coworkers and peers are doing/using around you. By becoming familiar with the laboratory you’re working in and always following proper safety procedures, you can help to prevent or eliminate hazards. You will also know the proper steps to take in the unfortunate event that something does go wrong. Labs are designed to with safety in mind, however, accidents can happen, which is why it’s best to be prepared for the worst.
          <br><br>
          <i>Electricity</i><br>
          In any lab, there are lots of electrical cords running throughout the room, keeping all of the electronics running efficiently. Although electricity is needed to run throughout the entirety of your laboratory, cords can become a safety hazard if not handled with care. Fire can breakout, individuals can trip and fall over cords, or electrical equipment can get destroyed as a result of a faulty electrical connection.
          <br><br>
          To prevent any of the aforementioned from happening, invest in power cords, outlets and power strips. Also, don’t leave cords near heat sources, avoid running cords on the ground near doorways, refrain from using extension cords and don’t connect power strips together.
          <br><br>
          Therefore, it is important that you watch the following <i>Lab Safety and Lab Behavior</i> video so you can complete the lab experiments safely and efficiently.
