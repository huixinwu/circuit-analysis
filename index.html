          This OER material is intended for use as the first level of Circuit Analysis, with emphasis in Direct Current - dc, for a two and four year engineering technology program. The lecture and laboratory manual contains fifteen weekly lecture and laboratory experiments, and eleven homework. The topics range from basic technical math through principles of circuit analysis such as series, parallel, and series-parallel dc circuit; network theorems (Thevenin’s theorem and maximum power transfer) and circuit methods of analysis (mesh and nodal analysis, source transformation, and source conversion) of solving dc circuits; dc power analysis; capacitance and inductance principles and transient circuit; and introduction to sinusoidal. The course includes a three hours of laboratory work.
          <br><br>
          Lab experiments include brief introduction of the experimental topics, step by step procedures, tables and graphs to record measurements, and questions to reinforce the understanding of the theory with the experimental results. Each lab experiment is designed to be completed using a two to three hour practicum period. For equipment, each lab station should include a dual adjustable DC power supply and a quality DMM capable of reading DC voltage, current and resistance.

		   <button class="collapsible">7. Circuit Theorem: Source Transformation</button>
          <div class="content">
            Chapter 7 presents a tools to solve complex circuit where the traditional method of series-parallel analysis is not enough to find the voltage and current within the circuit. A source transformation is the process of replacing a voltage source in series with a resistor R by a current source in parallel with the same resistor R, or vice versa. The purpose of this substitution is to allow the elements within the circuit to be rearranged, without changing the voltage and current equivalency, in a way that the circuit can be analyzed as series or parallel.
            <br><br>
            <p>
            By the end of chapter 7, students should be able to:

              <li>convert a current source in parallel with an equivalent resistor to a voltage source in series with the same resistor. </li>
              <li>convert a voltage source in series with an equivalent resistor to a current source in parallel with the same resistor.</li>
              <li>identify the most feasible way to apply a series or parallel source conversion in a complex resistivity circuit with different sources. </li>

        <button class="collapsible">8. Circuit Theorem: Superposition</button>
          <div class="content">
            Circuits with two or more sources usually can not be solved using the traditional method of solving series-parallel circuit. Therefore, Superposition is another circuit theorem uses to solve circuits with two or more sources. Superposition theorem determines the contribution of each independent source to the variable and then algebraically add them up.
            <br><br>
            The superposition principle states that the voltage across (or current through) an element in a linear circuit is the algebraic sum of the voltages across (or currents through) that element due to each independent source acting alone.
            <p>
              By the end of chapter 8,  students should be able to:
              <ul>

            Chapter 9 presents a circuit method of analysis to solve for a complex circuit. Mesh analysis provides another general procedure for analyzing circuits, using mesh currents as the circuit variables. Using mesh currents instead of element currents as circuit variables is convenient and reduces the number of equations that must be solved simultaneously.

        <button class="collapsible">10. Circuit Theorem: Thevenin's theorem </button>
          <div class="content">
            It often occurs in practice that a particular element in a circuit is variable (usually called the load) while other elements are fixed. As a typical example, a household outlet terminal may be connected to different appliances constituting a variable load. Each time the variable element is changed, the entire circuit has to be analyzed all over again. To avoid this problem, Thevenin’s theorem provides a technique by which the fixed part of the circuit is replaced by an equivalent circuit. (Fundamental of Electrical Circuit, page 139).
            <br><br>
            Chapter 10 introduces a new circuit thereom uses to analyze the equivalent voltage and resistance as seen in a load element in a circuit. This theorem is known as the Thevenin's theorem. Thevenin's theorem applies to a circuit where one element or branch of the circuit, the load, changes while the rest of the circuit is fixed. Therefore, instead of analyzing the entire circuit for each changes in the load branch, we can just simplify the fixed part of the circuit into one equivalent voltage source, Thevenin's voltage, VTH, in series with one equivalent resistance, Thevenin's resistance, RTH, as seen by the load element, RL. This simplified circuit results in one series circuit with three elements, VTH, RTH, and RL. Hence, it is easier to analyze the original from its equivalent Thevenin's circuit for each changes in RL.
            <p>
              By the end of chapter 10,  students should be able to:
              <ul>
                <li>find the equivalent Thevenin’s resistance in a circuit as seen by the load component. </li>
                <li>Find the equivalent Thevenin’s voltage source in a circuit as seen by the load component.</li>
              </ul>

            <div class="content">
              So far we have limited our study to resistive circuits. Chapter 12 introduces one new and important passive linear circuit element, which is the inductor. Unlike resistors, which dissipate energy, capacitors and inductors do not dissipate but store energy, which can be retrieved at a later time. For this reason, capacitors and inductors are called storage element. Capacitors will be introduced at Chapter 13.
              <br><br>
              Chapter 12 covers the fundamentals of magnetism and inductance, and how to solve the equivalent inductance of inductors connected in series, parallel, and series-parallel.
              <p>Be the end of chapter 12, students should be able to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>understand magnetism and the definition of magnetic field.</li>
                <li>find the equivalent inductance in series, parallel, and series-parallel connection. </li>

          <button class="collapsible">13. Capacitance and RC Transient Circuit</button>
            <div class="content">
              A capacitor is a passive element designed to store energy in its electric field. Besides resistors, capacitors are the most common electrical components. Chapter 13 covers the principle of electrical field, capacitance, and how to solve the equivalent capacitance connected in series, parallel, and series-parallel.
              <br><br>
              The second topic of chapter 13 is <i>Transient Response in a RC circuit</i>. In electric circuit, transient is a behavior of a circuit that occurs during a transition from one circuit condition to another that differs from the initial condition, such as the change in the amplitude, phase, shape, or frequency of the voltage acting in the circuit, the values of the parameters, or the configuration of the circuit. The Transient Response in a RC circuit is the way the circuit responds to energies stored in the capacitor, C, known as charging phase. If a capacitor has energy stored within it, then that energy can be dissipated/absorbed by a resistor, R, at the discharge phase.
              <p>By the end of chapter 13, students should be able to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>understand capacitance and the definition of electric field. </li>
                <li>find the equivalent capacitance in series, parallel, and series-parallel connection.</li>
                <li>analyze the time constant and instantaneous voltage across the resistor, VR, and capacitor, VC, and current through the capacitor, IC, in the charging phase of a RC circuit.</li>
                <li>graph the voltage across the resistor and capacitor, and the current through the capacitor in a RC circuit: charging and dischargin phase</li>
              </ul>

    <!-- LAB EXPERIMENTS -->
    <section class="labExp" id="labExp">
      <h2 class="subtitleProject">Lab Experiments</h2>
      <p class="labIntro">
        Lab experiments from this section is from a collaborative project between the department of Engineering Technology in Queensborough Community College, QCC, and the department of Computer Engineering Technology in New York City College of Technology, NYCCT, is based on creating two laboratory manual for the course of dc circuit analysis and ac circuit analysis. In QCC, the circuit analysis courses are major required courses for students on most of the engineering technology majors. In NYCCT, the circuit analysis courses are major required courses for students in the Electromechanical Engineering Technology and Computer Engineering Technology programs. Creation of these two laboratory manuals that covers the appropriate materials to a sufficient depth of learning circuits analysis while remains readable and accessible manner for the students.
        <br><br>
        This lab manual section is intended for use in DC circuit analysis laboratory for a two and four year engineering technology program. The laboratory manual contains 15 weekly lab experiments that include brief introduction of the experimental topics, step by step procedures, tables and graphs to record measurements, and questions to reinforce the understanding of the theory with the experimental results.
        Each lab experiment is designed to be completed using a two to three hour practicum period. The topics range from basic laboratory procedures and resistor identification through series-parallel circuits, mesh analysis, superposition theorem, Thévenin’s theorem, maximum power transfer theorem, and concludes with an introduction to capacitors and inductors. For equipment, each lab station should include a dual adjustable DC power supply and a quality DMM capable of reading DC voltage, current and resistance.

      <div class="content">
        <i style="font-size:0.8em;">Information retrieved from <a href="https://www.elitechgroup.com/news/product-news/the-importance-of-safety-in-the-lab">ELITechGroup: The importance of safety in the lab</a></i>
        <br><br>
        <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>
          Laboratories reap a wide array of safety hazards, which is why it is so vital to understand the important of lab safety. If something goes awry, more than just your research project schedule can be affected. Equipment can be damaged, fines can occur, and individuals on your team can be injured.
          <br><br>
          When working in a lab, it is important you to be familiar with the equipment in your working space, even if you don’t use it yourself. It’s also crucial to be cautious of what other researchers, coworkers and peers are doing/using around you. By becoming familiar with the laboratory you’re working in and always following proper safety procedures, you can help to prevent or eliminate hazards. You will also know the proper steps to take in the unfortunate event that something does go wrong. Labs are designed to with safety in mind, however, accidents can happen, which is why it’s best to be prepared for the worst.
          <br><br>
          <i>Electricity</i><br>
          In any lab, there are lots of electrical cords running throughout the room, keeping all of the electronics running efficiently. Although electricity is needed to run throughout the entirety of your laboratory, cords can become a safety hazard if not handled with care. Fire can breakout, individuals can trip and fall over cords, or electrical equipment can get destroyed as a result of a faulty electrical connection.
          <br><br>
          To prevent any of the aforementioned from happening, invest in power cords, outlets and power strips. Also, don’t leave cords near heat sources, avoid running cords on the ground near doorways, refrain from using extension cords and don’t connect power strips together.
          <br><br>
          Therefore, it is important that you watch the following <i>Lab Safety and Lab Behavior</i> video so you can complete the lab experiments safely and efficiently.

        <p>Laboratory reports are important tool to communicate and present experimental results. In an educational point of view, those reports help lab instructor to analyze the understanding, performance, and organization and analysis of results from students. On the other, in industry, company decisions are often made according to experimental work and result presented in a laboratory report to management.
        For engineering technology students, lab report can be written according to the course lab requirement. The most commonly used organization for laboratory reports are:
        <ul>
          <li>Cover page </li>
          <li>Abstract </li>
          <li>Introduction </li>
          <li>Brief description of procedure </li>
          <li>Experimental Results </li>
          <li>Results and Discussion </li>
          <li>Conclusion </li>
          <li>Appendices and Reference </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 style="text-decoration:underline">Abstract</h4>
        The abstract presents a brief introduction of the experiment. The abstract should be written concisely in normal rather than highly abbreviated English. The author should assume that the reader has some knowledge of the subject but has not read the paper. Thus, the abstract should be intelligible and complete in itself; particularly it should not cite figures, tables, or sections of the paper. The opening sentence or two should, in general, indicate the subjects dealt with in the paper and should state the objectives of the investigation. It is also desirable to describe the treatment by one or more such terms as brief, exhaustive, theoretical, experimental, and so forth.
        <h4 style="text-decoration:underline">Introduction</h4>
        The "Introduction" of a laboratory report identifies the experiment to be undertaken, the objectives of the experiment, the importance of the experiment, and overall background for understanding the experiment. The objectives of the experiment are important to state because these objectives are usually analyzed in the conclusion to determine whether the experiment succeeded.
        <h4 style="text-decoration:underline">Procedures And Experimental  </h4>
        The "Procedures," often called the "Methods," discusses how the experiment occurred. Documenting the procedures of your laboratory experiment is important not only so that others can repeat your results but also so that you can replicate the work later, if the need arises. Historically, laboratory procedures have been written as first-person narratives as opposed to second-person sets of instructions. Because your audience expects you to write the procedures as a narrative, you should do so.
        <br>
        The Experimental part includes the recollection of data using tables, graphic analysis, calculations, and question analysis. These are important to represent because they are supporting materials for the analysis and discussion of experimental results.
        <h4 style="text-decoration:underline">Results and Discussion</h4>
        The heart of a laboratory report is the presentation of the results and the discussion of those results. In some formats, "Results" and "Discussion" appear as separate sections. However, P.B. Medawar [1979] makes a strong case that the two should appear together, particularly when you have many results to present (otherwise, the audience is faced with a "dump" of information that is impossible to synthesize). Much here depends upon your experiment and the purpose of your laboratory report. Therefore, pay attention to what your laboratory instructor requests. Also, use your judgment. For instance, combine these sections when the discussion of your first result is needed to understand your second result, but separate these sections when it is useful to discuss the results as a whole after all results are reported.
        <br>
        For experiment where data is recorded in tables and/or presented in graphs, those information should be organized and link to the discussion to support the experiment findings. In discussing the results, you should not only analyze the results, but also discuss the implications of those results. Moreover, pay attention to the errors that existed in the experiment, both where they originated and what their significance is for interpreting the reliability of conclusions.
        <h4 style="text-decoration:underline">Conclusion</h4>
        In longer laboratory reports, a "Conclusion" section often appears. Whereas the "Results and Discussion" section has discussed the results individually, the "Conclusion" section discusses the results in the context of the entire experiment. Usually, the objectives mentioned in the "Introduction" are examined to determine whether the experiment succeeded. If the objectives were not met, you should analyze why the results were not as predicted. Note that in shorter reports or in reports where "Discussion" is a separate section from "Results," you often do not have a "Conclusion" section.
        <h4 style="text-decoration:underline">Appendices</h4>
        In a laboratory report, appendices often are included. One type of appendix that appears in laboratory reports presents information that is too detailed to be placed into the report's text. For example, if you had a long table giving voltage-current measurements for an RLC circuit, you might place this tabular information in an appendix and include a graph of the data in the report's text. Another type of appendix that often appears in laboratory reports presents tangential information that does not directly concern the experiment's objectives.
        <br>One sample of an Appendices for Design of a Temperature Measurement and Display System Using the 68HC11 Microcontroller is:
        <dl>
          <dt style="color:black;"><b>Appendix A: Hardware Schematic </b></dt>
          <dd>Figure A-1 presents the hardware schematic for the temperature circuit. The circuit was designed according to the specifications obtained from the Computer Engineering Laboratories web site for ECPE 4535 [Lineberry, 2001]. </dd>
        </dl>
        <h4 style="text-decoration:underline">References</h4>
        A reference gives the readers details about the source so that they have a good understanding of what kind of source it is and could find the source themselves if necessary. The references are typically listed at the end of the lab report.
